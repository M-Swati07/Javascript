/*
LECTURE: Object Methods

1. Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method 
will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous 
assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword.

2. Call the 'describe' method

3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This 
method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'. 
'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if 
there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.

console.log(myCountry.describe());  //don't forget to give the () incase of calling the functions
console.log(myCountry.checkIsland());
console.log(myCountry.isIsland);    //if you only write line 37 and not 36 line 37 will not execute, but if u write line 36 and then write line 37 then it works. IDK how ðŸ™„
